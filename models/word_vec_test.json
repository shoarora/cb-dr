{"targetParagraphs": ["Dean Potter jumped. Graham Hunt followed. Potter\u2019s longtime girlfriend snapped photographs. Then came confusion, hope and despair. YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. \u2014 Afternoon gave way to evening, and the parade of restless clouds and the occasional bursts of rain had moved on from Yose", "ite Valley. In their wake was the empty quiet of Taft Point, 3,000 feet above a famous green valley going gray in late-day shadow. There were no tourists, only a raven, black and unhurried, circl", "ng at the edge of the cliff. It spiraled upward, a silent signal of rising air. A good sign for BASE jumping and wing-suit flying. Dean Potter, a 43-year-old professional climber and j", "mper, considered one of the world\u2019s best in a wing suit, stood a few feet from Graham Hunt, 29, his apprentice and flying partner. About 20 feet to their right was Jen Rapp, Potter\u2019s longtime girlfriend, and the couple\u2019s dog, Whis", "er. Rapp held a camera. She framed the photos so that El Capitan, across the valley toward the setting sun, was in the background. BASE jumping is illegal in the national parks. But that did not keep people from surreptitiously doing it, at th", " risk of being caught, especially in Yosemite, where the ", "heer cliffs make it the best place on the planet to do it, some believe. \u201cAnywhere else you go is a compromise,\u201d Potter would say. The men had jumped from dozens of spots around Yosemite Valley, but they knew this route well. At the end of a 1.1-mile downhill trail from a small parking lot on Glacier Point Road, Taft Point is marked by a railing meant to keep tourists from falling. Potter and Hunt preferred jumping from an edge about 100 yards left, to the west. They would drop hundreds of feet with their arms an", " legs spread, the webbing between their limbs and the baffles inside their suits filling with air until falling turned to soaring. They would fly right, toward the heart of the valley. There is a sloping rib of a ridge there, a relatively unremarkable feature called Lost Brother. It is not marked on the park maps handed to visitors. It juts downward into ", "he valley before it ends abruptly into a vertical wall known mostly to climbers. In that ridge is a notch, a V like a rifle sight. Potter and Hunt had made the jump many times, sometimes together, sometimes not. Hunt had done it without Potter several days before. He would usually steer himself through the notch. Potter had been through the notch a couple o", " times, but he usually went around the ridge to the left. It depended on how well they maintained altitude once they began to fly. The men were zipped into their suits. They did not wait for the full c", "oak of dusk. A breeze from behind caught their attention but did not send a strong enough warning to pause. It was 7:25 on May 16. \u201cI don\u2019t mind if I\u2019m on the record,\u201d Potter wrote in an email in March, discussing the decades-long fig", "t to legalize BASE jumping within National Park Service sites, and especially at Yosemite, with its unique valley of sheer cliffs. \u201cI\u2019", "e been flying in the park since 2003 and the N.P.S. knows it, but they haven\u2019t been able to catch me or prove anything,\u201d he added. Potter offered a tour of the BASE-jumping culture at Yosemi", "e, allowing himself to be captured on video leaping, illegally, from the cliffs at dusk or dawn and landing before being detected. \u201cThere are at least 10 local guys who are regularly BASE jumping in Yosemite and proba", "ly 50 to 100 others annually traveling to Yosemite from around the world to experience the birthplace of big-wall BASE,\u201d he wrote. Potter knew the long history of enforcement at Yosemite. Robin Heid was arrested and charged with jumping off El Capitan in 1979, which helped lead to a midsummer trial run for legal parachuting there in 1980, aborted after six weeks of unruliness. BASE jumping took hold in the global", "extreme-sports culture of the 1990s, and stories of Yosemite rangers hiding in trees and using night-vision goggles became legend. In 1999, Frank Gambalie drowned in the Merced River after trying to escape rangers. Months later, in a protest of park policy and enforcement, Jan Davis fell to her death from El Capitan without her parachute ever ope", "ing; she wore a borrowed rig, not wanting her own gear confiscated. In 2010, Ammon McNeely was caught and subdued with a stun gun. In between, dozens have been arrested, jailed and subjected to thousands of dollars in fines and have had their gear", "confiscated. Several have gone to court to challenge the National Park Service rules banning the activity, ultimately to no avail. It made no sense to Potter, and plenty of others, that climbing was legal, and that falling was legal, but that stopping a fall with a lifesaving parachute was illegal, a result of the appli", "ation of an arcane law banning the delivery or retrieval \u201cof a person or object by parac", "ute, helicopter or other airborne means.\u201d But it was 2015. Potter was hopeful. He believed he could be both renegade and diplomat. \u201cThe N.P.S. and the law enforcement have changed a lot in the past year or two,\u201d Potter wrote in March. \u201cMost all of the lead positions in the park service are now held by people who either don\u2019t have a huge problem with BASE or are quite lenient when it comes to catching and prosecuting jumpers. For sure the rangers enforce the law. If they see", "us, they pursue, but for the most part, they are not hunting us as before and there seems to be a lot more respect on both sides.\u201d A sport that began as a rebel offshoot of sky diving had evolved into a popular and respected derivative of rock climbing. Places in Switzerland, Norway and Italy welcomed BASE jumpers. And Yosemite, the best place \u2014 maybe the safest place, with its vertical cliffs and g", "assy landing areas \u2014 had only six known BASE-jumping deaths in its history, and none since 1999, despite thousands of jumps since. Potter jumped. Hunt followed, like a s", "adow. Rapp clicked photographs. The men fell out of the frame before her lens caught them falling away, soaring with wings spread. Hunt quickly passed Potter. His suit was made for speed. Potter had set records for long flights and ", "referred loft. He had been in Canada working on a design to allow him to land on his belly on glacial ice, no parachute necessary. \u201cHe\u2019s low,\u201d Rapp thought to herself. \u201cWhy is he going toward the notch?\u201d She saw Hunt veer left, as if to go around the ridg", ", then quickly back to the right. Potter held his line for the notch. They disappeared into the hole that led to the dusky valley. Rapp heard a thwap. Her mind tried ", "o tell her that it was the familiar sound of a parachute deploying. It was ", "ollowed almost immediately by a duller, heavier sound. Rapp waited alone on the cliff\u2019s edge for more clues from below. None came. She clicked through her camera to retrace the flight paths in the photos. In two dimensions, without depth perception, it was hard to tell what happened to the shrinking specks in the frames. There was Hunt, who disappeared into the gray", "ess of the rocks. There was Potter, who made it through the leading edge of the notch, a downward halfpipe, and fell out of sight. Somewhere far below was Rebecca Haynie, Hunt\u2019s girlfriend of a few months. She had been on a hike when Hunt called saying that he and Potter planned to jump at Taft Point. Meet at ", "he meadow at 7:30, Hunt said. She aborted her hike and went to the lodge area in Yosemite Valley to get a drink and pass the time. She did not see a text message that Hunt sent at 6:55 until about 7:25 because of spotty cellular service in Yosemite. He had asked her to turn on her two-way radio so they could communicate. She quickly texted ba", "k that she would in a few minutes. She drove around the darkening, forested roads for 90 minutes, waiting to hear from Hunt again. ", "I was putting my faith in a lot of irrational places,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cEven though I knew what probably happened.\u201d In the dwindling light, Rapp rushed back up the trail to the parking l", "t. She drove her car the 13 miles or so back to Wawona Road, made a right and headed the 10 miles down to the floor of the valley. She went to El Capitan Meadow, but there was no one there. Her phone had no text messages. Unsure of what to do or where to go, she drove to the rented house that she and Potter shared in Yosemite West, a cluster of homes back up Wawona Road, past the Glacier Point turnoff. The couple recently bought 31 acres nearby and had plans to build their own home. That day, rainy and cool, had been spent clear", "ng trees and brush, and Hunt was there to help, until the clearing skies led to the idea of making an evening jump off Taft Point. The house was dark and empty. Mind racing, Rapp studied the photos and scrolled through various outcomes in her head. Maybe the sounds she heard were Hunt crashing. Maybe Potter saw it happen and was searching for h", "s friend. Maybe Potter crashed and was hurt. Maybe they were both O.K. but were hiding from rangers. Maybe they had been arrested. Her mind w", "s a tug of war with hope. Maybe they would pull up to the house any minute. A car came at 9:30. Out stepped Haynie. She was alone. A little more than a year earlier, in March 2014, one of Potter\u2019s best friends and flying partners, Sean Leary, was killed BASE jumping at Ut", "h\u2019s Zion National Park. It was only the second known BASE-jumping death at Zion, but the first had come just over a month earlier. Leary, alone, had apparently jumped off a sandstone tower called West Temple and tried to fly through a gap in the Three Marys, a set of statue-l", "ke formations resembling chess pieces. Leary was missing for days, and Potter was among those who rushed to Zion to help find him. Potter and a few other climbers reached Leary\u2019s body, but the park service would not", "allow them to bring it down. Rangers packaged the body, and a helicopter, borrowed from Grand Canyon National Park, lifted it out. \u201cThere are places within the United States that one can BASE jump, but not in Zion,\u201d the park\u2019s then-superintendent said in a news release. \u201cThere are many reasons for this, from resource protect", "on, to visitor and employee safety, to Wilderness mandates. BASE jumping is not congruent with the founding purpose of this park.\u201d Ray O\u2019Neal, a longtime ranger at Zion, sa", "d that the problem with BASE jumping in national parks was not necessarily one of safety or rescue costs, as many jumpers presume. \u201cThe reason we would like to discourage it is not so much because of the danger of it, but the spectacle of it,\u201d O\u2019Neal said during an interview at the park\u2019s E", "ergency Operations Center. \u201cWe like to think that people come here to enjoy the scenery, and not the spectacle of people jumping.\u201d Scott Gediman, a Yosemite park spokesman, agreed. On av", "rage, 14 Yosemite visitors die each year \u2014 from falls or drownings, car accidents or natural causes. Rarely are they BASE jumpers. \u201cWe\u2019re not against BASE jumping as a sport,\u201d Gediman said while sitting on a bench at Yosemite, where a rap", "elling accident had killed a climber the day before. \u201cBut we have to look at the big picture and its appropriateness in the park.\u201d The frustration for Potter and other BASE advocates has been the apparent lack of consistency in park policies. It is generally legal to catch a fish but not to pick flowers. Horses are allowed on many trails, but mountain bikers are not. The Merced River is a jumble of colorful rafts carrying tourists; El Capitan is a dot-to-dot slate of climbers and ropes; and Yosemite even allows hang gliding on a limited basis off Glacier Point, not far from Taft Point. Potter was all", "wed to string tightropes between formations. But if he fell, it was illegal, in th", "ory, to prevent his own death with a parachute. A video from one of Graham Hunt\u2019s last successful BASE jumps, in Adobe Mesa, Utah. In 2006, the last time the National Park Service updated its management policies, individual park superintendents were allowed the discretion to pursue approval of BASE jumping. None have. (The exception in the national park system is the annual Bridge Day at New River Gorge, in West Virginia, where hundreds take part in a one-day jumping celebration that dates back nearly 40 years.) Potter thought times were changing. He pondered ways to devise a permit system, to limit the number of BASE jumpers and to ensure that only well-trained jumpers would leap into the valley. He did not have that part figured out yet. But it was his goal", " He wanted nothing more than to BASE jump and fly wing suits legally in Yosemite, the place that he loved more than anywhere else. The women drove back into the black valley. They looked for people they knew \u2014 climbers camping or hanging around the village and the bar. There were no familiar faces. At about 10:30, the", " showed up at the door of Mike Gauthier, Yosemite\u2019s chief of staff, a conduit between park bureaucracy and the climbing community. A call to the Yosemite d", "spatcher quickly deflated hope that Potter and Hunt were in custody. There were no reports of BASE jumpers caught by park rangers. A late-night search was called. Rangers and volunteers from Yosemite Search and Rescue were told that a pair of BASE jumpers were missin", " off Taft Point. It was not until they saw Rapp that they realized that one of the men missing was Dean Potter. Everyone knew him. \u201cI ho", "ed he was just hurt,\u201d Rapp said. \u201cMaybe he had two broken femurs. Maybe he was bleeding to death. We just needed to get up there.\u201d She tried to leave the searching to the experts. But at 4 a.m., helplessly waiting, she took binoculars and headed to the base of the canyon b", "low Lost Brother. She scanned the darkness for movement or color. She screamed into the black void above her. She got no response. There were still no answers from above by daybreak. A ", "elicopter took off and headed over the top of Lost Brother. Two bodies were quickly spotted. Neither man had deployed a parachute. Hunt had cleare", " the base of the notch, but having most likely entered the downward funnel on a diagonal path, he had crashed i", "to the right wall. \u201cTurns out the sounds I heard, I think, were the sounds of Graham hitting a tree and then the wall,\u201d Rapp said. Potter was found several hundred feet farther into the notch. Speculation began immediately that maybe the sight of Hunt, or the air disturbance caused by his maneuvers, had affected Potter\u2019s concentration or control. Neither man was wearing a GoPro video recorder, contrary to some news reports, but Potter had jumped with a smartphone strapped to", "his head. It was heavily damaged, but park service investigators have it, along with Rapp\u2019s photos, hoping to mine them for clues. Rapp returned to Taft Point three days after the accident. By then, there was a memorial at the cliff\u2019s edge, where Potter and Hunt had made their final jump. El Capitan sits across the valley a little to the left; Yosemite Falls can be seen a little to the right, over the top of the bro", "n, down-sloping ridge with the notch. The memorial included feathers, a beer can, Tibetan prayer flags and a photograph of Potter. Rapp sat alone on a rock. A rav", "n appeared.

School was almost over and the classroom, scattered with posters, worksheets and lesson plans, was buzzing with chatty, curious 10-, 11- and 12-year-olds who knew they'd soon be free from class. But before dismissal, one exercise remained. The kids shuffled from grouped tables to neat, forward-facing rows of desks. Walker counted down from five, telling her students to make sure the table tops were cleared. A boy walked to the front of the classroom, sat in a chair to face his classmates, and rang a bell. Nearly in unison, the 25 students in class 601 at New York City's Brooklyn Urban Garden School closed their eyes. Some put their hands over their faces, creating little bubbles of darkness. Others put their heads down, as if to fall asleep.", "It was Quiet Time, which is exactly what it sounds like. In a city where silence is elusive, these students begin and end the day with it. If they choose to, they can meditate.", "The students sat for 15 minutes without making a sound. From the outside, it looked like nothing was happening. But nearly three-quarters of the students later said they spent the time meditating, reaching the inner depths of their consciousness in deep relaxation.", "After Quiet Time that day, a handful of students opened up about it.", "\u201cI get into a lot more arguments with people when I do not meditate. I think it makes you feel less stressed,\u201d one boy said. \u201cYour mind goes to rest, and we need that,\u201d a girl added. \u201cIt\u2019s resting your mind, but I also think it\u2019s about school,\u201d another boy chimed in. \u201cWhen I meditate, my grades go higher.\u201d BUGS, as the charter school is called, adopted Quiet Time when it opened in 2013. The school focuses on sustainability and holistic education and has three full-time staffers who teach kids about the practice of and science behind meditation. Located in Brooklyn\u2019s Windsor Terrace neighborhood, BUGS serves New York City\u2019s District 15, which includes some of the richest and poorest neighborhoods in the city. The school has about 200 students, nearly half of whom qualify for free or reduced lunch, and nearly one-quarter of whom have disabilities.", "Quiet Time was developed in the 1990s by a Washington, D.C., school principal. It was initially intended to be a one-off effort, but it took off: In the last seven years especially, it has expanded, and now appears in 18 schools across the country.", "It's one of a handful of meditation programs funded by the New York-based David Lynch Foundation; others target veterans, survivors of sexual assault and domestic abuse, prisoners and people who are HIV-positive. The organization focuses on Transcendental Meditation, a method made famous by the late Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The technique\u2019s best-known American practitioner may be the foundation\u2019s namesake, director and TV producer David Lynch.", "Lynch, a longtime TM proponent who studied under Maharishi, established the foundation in 2005 to fund meditation instruction in schools in the U.S. and abroad. In the last decade, it's garnered $30 million to spread meditation across the world, and boasts of having taught 500,000 students in more than a dozen countries, including Peru, South Africa and Israel. Ultimately, the organization's goal is to raise enough money to allow any school system in the world interested in Quiet Time to institute the program, said Bob Roth, the foundation's executive director.", "\"Long term,\" Roth said, \"we think meditation should be offered just like P.E.\"", "TM consists of repeating a personalized mantra -- it can\u2019t be a word or a sound that has actual meaning, as those are deemed distracting -- silently for 20 minutes. Kids, like those at BUGS, do it for shorter periods. Compared to other methods of meditation, TM requires \u201cno concentration, no control of the mind, no contemplation, no monitoring of thoughts,\u201d according to official TM materials.", "\u201cIn a city where silence is elusive, these students begin and end the day with it.\u201d", "Meditation teachers often use an analogy of the sea to describe the process. \u201cYou\u2019re in a small boat in the middle of the ocean and all of a sudden, you get these huge swells. You think the whole ocean is in upheaval. Well, if you take a cross-section of the ocean, you\u2019ll see the surface is active but the depth is naturally silent,\u201d said Roth, who has meditated for more than 40 years. \u201cThe surface of our mind is the active, thinking mind. I call it the \u2018gotta gotta gotta gotta mind.\u2019 But deep within us is a level of the mind that's already calm, already wide awake. It\u2019s part us, but we\u2019ve just lost access to it.\u201d Through twice-a-day meditation, practitioners believe everyone can access an intensely deep rest that allows the body to repair itself and \u201crelease deeply rooted stress and tension that sleep never gets rid of,\u201d Roth said.", "And that kind of deep rest, he and others believe, can be incredibly beneficial. Among adults, scientific studies have shown that people who meditate have lower stress levels and a decreased risk of high blood pressure. They also report greater levels of happiness and confidence.", "Because the Quiet Time program is relatively new, data on its impact on kids is limited, but early studies point to better grades, fewer suspensions and reports of better mental health among student meditators.", "\u201cWhen you meditate, you produce alpha waves, your body calms down, your pulse drops, you go out of the fight-or-flight mode. Your cortisol levels drop. Your body gets a break. It feels pleasant,\u201d said Joshua Aronson, an associate professor of applied psychology at New York University who has studied the impact of Quiet Time on students.", "The David Lynch Foundation focuses its efforts on middle schools and high schools with higher-than-average rates of absenteeism, teacher turnover, and gaps in grades and graduation rates. In a survey released last month, the Council of Chief State School Officers and Scholastic Inc. found that the nation's highest-ranked teachers named family stress, poverty, and learning and psychological problems as the top barriers to academic success.", "\u201cYour body chemistry and brain activity is set up to keep you alive,\u201d Aronson said. \u201cThese kids in the inner city, they are in this fight-or-flight mode that has their body focused on that, and in that situation they are chronically hyperalert. They can't care at a deep level about algebra because the brain doesn\u2019t care about high-level abstract reasoning when the switch has flipped and it\u2019s trying to keep you alive. That constitutes to a severe bar on the readiness to learn.\u201d", "Meditation is one tool that can help students clear that bar, he said.", "Quiet Time is part of a broader movement among education districts and individual schools experimenting with programs that include mandatory yoga and optional lessons in mindfulness.", "In the first semester of Quiet Time at Visitacion Valley Middle School in San Francisco, which introduced the program in 2007 and is in a district that has become the one of its strongest supporters, administrators reported that suspensions dropped by 45 percent among students who participated in Quiet Time compared to those who didn\u2019t. Over three years, Visitacion Valley, which is located in one of the most violent neighborhoods in the city, saw a 75 percent overall drop in suspensions. About 20 percent of students now are accepted to Lowell High School, the top public high school in the city. Before the launch of Quiet Time, only a few made the cut each year.", "\u201cI look at meditation as being an umbrella that we were able to put over the top of the school and keep the rain off.\u201d", "\u201cA lot of schools are trying mindfulness and meditation, but some of the ones I\u2019ve studied make the mistake of just teaching it to the kids and telling them to do it at home. They see very little results,\u201d Aronson said. \u201cThe genius of Quiet Time is that it makes this a ritual during the school day.\u201d \u201cWhen I first got there, there was a fight or two every day,\u201d said James Dierke, who was the principal of Visitacion Valley for 13 years and is currently the executive vice president of the American Federation of School Administrators. \u201cStudents were always on guard, and so were teachers. ... But, it was also kind of a taboo subject to talk about meditation and PTSD in children.\u201d", "A directive to improve test scores forced administrators to get creative. The school pushed counseling services and peer mediation, after-school tutoring, sports and music lessons and better ties to community groups. Then, it introduced kids to Quiet Time. Although it took several years, Dierke says meditation did the most to turn the school around.", "\u201cI look at meditation as being an umbrella that we were able to put over the top of the school and keep the rain off,\u201d he said.", "Many of his fellow educators agree. Currently, five schools in San Francisco have Quiet Time, and Superintendent Richard Carranza has said that he wants to see it expand.", "With Quiet Time schools in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Detroit, New Haven, Connecticut, and Washington, D.C., Roth and his David Lynch Foundation colleagues are currently looking to bring Quiet Time into Chicago schools.", "Walker, the BUGS teacher in Brooklyn, occasionally joins her students in meditation or does it on her own before the school day begins.", "\u201cFor myself, when I don\u2019t meditate, I am a little more of a scatterbrain,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed in my students that if they miss the morning Quiet Time if they are late to class, they are the same way.\u201d She said one of her students who has \u201cissues with anger\u201d occasionally leaves the classroom to meditate to avoid an outburst. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a magic bullet,\u201d said BUGS co-founder Miriam Nunberg, who previously was a special education teacher and attorney at the Department of Education. \u201cDo we still see kids acting out? Of course we do. But we give them a tool to cope with stress and anxiety and help them focus.\u201d Quiet Time isn\u2019t without its detractors. When it was first launched in California, some parents, as well as a nonprofit called Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, protested, saying the practice was rooted in Hinduism and violated the First Amendment. Meanwhile, the Hindu American Foundation ran a campaign about the importance of honoring the Hindu roots of yoga and meditation, and called out TM for its secular approach.", "But Roth and others who promote TM say the practice doesn't require any specific beliefs. These days, the complaints are less frequent. However, kids do need parental permission to participate in meditation.", "The ritual, like nearly everything else in school, is also graded. At BUGS, each student is scored by the teacher on a zero-to-two scale every time he or she meditates. A two means a student sits up with his or her eyes closed for most of Quiet Time. A one means a student\u2019s eyes are open or his or her head is down for most of the session. Students who cause a disturbance get a zero. Each trimester, students\u2019 average scores are converted to grades that go on their report cards. In the hallway, a scoreboard keeps track of the classes with the highest weekly Quiet Time scores, while a display case has two trophies from the past year\u2019s winning sixth- and seventh-grade classes.", "\u201cSome [students] took it as a joke at the beginning, like they didn\u2019t really get what it was,\u201d said Walker, who is in her first year as a BUGS teacher. \u201cBut now they are learning about the brain in class, and they are talking about neurons -- how you can wake them up and put them to sleep, and how meditation can help heal your brain and body. I really see it making a difference.\u201d"]}

Salmond, the former Scottish first minister, says it is wrong to make such a fundamental constitutional change without legislation.", "Cameron\u2019s spokeswoman said: \u201cThe government will bring forward its proposals in this parliamentary session. What we are seeking to do with these proposals is to balance the principle of English consent for English measures with MPs from all parts of the country continuing to deliberate and vote together. That is what we will seek to achieve with these proposals when we set them out in this parliamentary session.\u201d"]}
